# Onix_Synthesizer

Onix software synthesizer is an Java open source virtual synthesizer software, is based on the JSynth library, and I'm currently being developed.

With the time, i have on mind, create the Standalone version, and create the vst version, compatible with music creation Daws, like Cubase, Ableton Live or Fl Studio, with midi suported and more characteristics.
The actual state of the software is "In development".
